        "# Identifying CSR board committees\n",
        "In this notebook, I am preprocessing the committee data from Refinitiv Eikon and identify which companies have a CSR related committee and which do not. Refinitiv has two data sources for committee information. First, they have a separate data field which lists CSR related committees on the board level AND the executive level. Because I am only interested in board level committees, I cannot use this list. Second, the director data from Refinitiv Eikon also contains information on the type of board committees a company has and which director is a part of those committees (albeit this dataset is missing the time period of committee membership, which therefore still needs to be manually gathered from DEF 14As). However, this director data only contains CSR related committees if their sole purpose is CSR. In many cases, companies have nominating and/or governance committees which also oversee sustainability and CSR at companies. Therefore, I cannot use this list alone either because there are many relevant committees missing from this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, in this notebook, I am using the information from the two sources as an indication for the manual review I will be doing of the DEF 14As for the missing biographies and the missing committee information. The final excel file which I write in this notebook contains all relevant companies and directors with the additional information on potentially relevant CSR board committees. This list was then completed by manually researching missing biographies and committee information from DEF 14A filings."

This additional code has now resulted in a different review list that was generated at the end of this notebook and saved as `dir_bio_comm_all.xlsx`. The manual review has been completed with the previous version of this excel list. However, it is not possible for me under the current time constraints, to revert those changes in the biography matching notebook to again generate the original excel list. Therefore, we will all have to live with this slight discrepancy in the lists generated for manual review.\n",
