        "In this notebook I am creating a file that includes the control variables for each company and each year and I am matching the ISINs to those firms. In addition, I am identifying all relevant directors that sit on the board between 2011 and 2015 of all relevant companies (using the Refinitiv Eikon director data). Moreover, I run some sanity checks to see whether the director data is complete. Comparing the number of directors taken from the Refinitiv data to the board size data (also from Refinitiv), I can see that there are many inconsistencies (for details, scroll further down). However, it is not possible to manually confirm who is sitting on these boards, so I will accept the Refinitiv Eikon director data as is and assume that this represents the correct and true board composition per company and year. I will write the preprocessed director data and the committee data (also from Refinitiv Eikon) to csv files so that they can be used in the `biography_matching` notebook and the `csr_committees` notbook."

If I consider a variance of 1, then about 80% are correct. I think it is reasonable to consider these variances of 1 as acceptable because some directors may only be on the board a couple of months and the board size - which relates to the size at the end of the fiscal year - does not capture them then.\n",
